## 1.0.1
  - Include support for plugins running on Logstash 6.8 [#5](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-mixin-ca_trusted_fingerprint_support/pull/5)

## 1.0.0
  - Support Mixin for adding API-compatibility with the CATrustedFingerprintSupport introduced in Logstash 8.3 [#2](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-mixin-ca_trusted_fingerprint_support/pull/2)
    - When a plugin includes this support adapter, and the plugin is run on
      a version of Logstash that does not provide an implementation, the
      plugin operates as normal but rejects explicit attempts to use
      the `ca_trusted_fingerprint` option.
